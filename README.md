# AVA is an automatic vibrato and portamento detection and analysis tool

AVA is an automatic vibrato and portamento detection and analysis tool. It accepts raw audio and automatically tracks the vibrato and portamento toÂ display their expressive parameters for inspection and further statistical analysis.

The applications of AVA include music education and expression analysis, and its outputs provide a useful base for expression synthesis and transformation.

AVA can do:

- on monophonic audio
- vibrato detection
- output vibrato rate, extent and sinusoid similarity
- portamento detection
- output Logistic-based portamento parameters
- allow user to correct the detections

AVA can't do
- on polyphonic audio
- change the vibrato and portamento directly

AVA-export is the exporeted Matlab-plugin. You could access to source code in other folders.
