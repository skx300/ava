To get yin to work on your system, put yin/ on your matlab path.

Yin uses mex files for its private routines.  Precompiled mex files are
for several platforms.  If there aren't any for yours, you must compile 
them yourself.  Go to 
	yin/private/src 
In matlab, for each filename.c, type 
	mex filename.c
then move the mex files produced to 
	/yin/private/
